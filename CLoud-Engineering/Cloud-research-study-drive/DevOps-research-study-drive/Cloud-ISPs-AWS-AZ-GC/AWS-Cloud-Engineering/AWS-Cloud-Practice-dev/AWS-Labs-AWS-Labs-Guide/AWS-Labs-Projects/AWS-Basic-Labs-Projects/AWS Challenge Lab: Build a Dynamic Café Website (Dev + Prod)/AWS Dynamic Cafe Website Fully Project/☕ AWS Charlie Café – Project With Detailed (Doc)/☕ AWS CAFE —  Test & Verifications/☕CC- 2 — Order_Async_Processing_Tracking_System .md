}
```

#### ✅ New UPDATED API GATEWAY CURL TEST AFTER ADDED TABLE NUMBER (REQUIRED)

```
curl -X POST \
  https://4njilbv5oj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "table_number": 3,
    "customer_name": "TestUser",
    "item": "Latte",
    "quantity": 1
  }'
```

#### 🟢 Expected Response (SUCCESS)

```
{
  "message": "Order saved successfully",
  "table_number": 3
}
```

#### 🟢 API GATEWAY TEST (MANDATORY)

- **go to  CafeOrderAPI > post method > Test Event Body**

```
{
  "table_number": 5,
  "customer_name": "Charlie",
  "item": "Coffee",
  "quantity": 2
}
```

#### Expected Result

```
{
  "message": "Order saved successfully",
  "table_number": 5
}
```

### 2️⃣ Verify Database

### Method 1 Simple 1-To-1 RDS Test

```
mysql -u cafe_user -p cafe_db
```

or

```
mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u cafe_user -p
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY id DESC;
```
or 
```
use cafe_db;
```
```
SELECT * FROM orders;
```

#### You should see:

```
EC2-Test | Latte | 1
```

#### Updated RDS

```
SELECT id, table_number, customer_name, item, quantity, created_at
FROM orders
ORDER BY id DESC;
```

✔ table_number populated

✔ created_at auto-generated

✔ No duplicate or missing fields

---

#### 3️⃣ Check CloudWatch Logs

- **Lambda → Monitor → Logs**

### You should see:

```
START RequestId:
END RequestId:
```

❌ No SQL errors

---

### 🟢 Common Mistakes (Avoid These)

| Mistake                | Result             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Missing `table_number` | 500 error          |
| table_number as string | Type error         |
| quantity ≤ 0           | Validation failure |
| Wrong API stage        | Order not inserted |

### 🟢 SYSTEM STATUS CHECK

✔ API Gateway updated

✔ Lambda aligned

✔ RDS schema aligned

✔ Frontend orders.php aligned

Your system is now schema-consistent from browser → DB.

**✅ PHASE 7️⃣ STATUS**

> **🟢 PHASE 7️⃣ COMPLETE & VERIFIED**

## 🟢 SECTION 1️⃣ COMPLETE & VERIFIED
---
## 🛠 SECTION 3️⃣ — AWS CAFE SQS (Async Order Processing)

## PHASE 3️⃣ — Verification SQS/LAMBDA (Producer)

#### 1️⃣ CREATE LAMBDA TEST (CONSOLE TEST)

- Click Test

- Select Create new test event

- Event name:

```
ApiOrderTest
```

Event JSON:


```
{
  "body": "{\"table_number\":1,\"customer_name\":\"ConsoleTest\",\"item\":\"Latte\",\"quantity\":2}"
}
```

Click Save

Click Test

#### Expected Result (SUCCESS)

```
{
  "statusCode": 202,
  "body": "{\"message\":\"Order accepted\",\"order\":{\"table_number\":1,\"customer_name\":\"ConsoleTest\",\"item\":\"Latte\",\"quantity\":2}}"
}
```

#### CloudWatch Logs:

```
Order accepted
```

#### SQS:

- Message appears briefly

- Then disappears (worker consumes it)

#### RDS:

```
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY id DESC;
```

#### Result:

```
id | table_number | customer_name | item  | quantity | created_at
---------------------------------------------------------------
12 | 1            | ConsoleTest   | Latte | 2        | 2026-01-xx
```

#### 2️⃣ VERIFY MESSAGE IN SQS (CRITICAL)

- AWS Console → SQS

- Click CafeOrdersQueue

- Click Send and receive messages

- Click Poll for messages

#### Expected Output:

You should see message like:

```
{
  "customer_name": "ConsoleTest",
  "item": "Latte",
  "quantity": 2
}
```

✅ If message exists → Producer Lambda WORKS

#### SQS Message Body (Manual Test)

```
{
  "table_number": 2,
  "customer_name": "WorkerTest",
  "item": "Latte",
  "quantity": 2
}
```
---

### 3️⃣ Frontend (orders.php)

You already fixed it ✔
Ensure payload includes:

```
{
  "table_number": 1,
  "customer_name": "Charlie",
  "item": "Tea",
  "quantity": 2
}
```

### 4️⃣ Test with API Gateway or Lambda test

#### Update test body

```
{
  "table_number": 3,
  "customer_name": "ApiTest",
  "item": "Coffee",
  "quantity": 1
}
```
#### curl Test

```
curl -X POST \
  https://svirhyw5a3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"table_number":3,"customer_name":"CurlTest","item":"Tea","quantity":2}'
```

### 🔍 METHOD A — TEST USING LAMBDA CONSOLE (EASIEST)

> **This tests only the Lambda logic, not API Gateway.**

#### 🟦 A1 — OPEN THE PRODUCER LAMBDA

- AWS Console → Lambda

- Click your Order API Lambda
(the one sending messages to SQS)

#### 🟦 A2 — CREATE A TEST EVENT

- Click Test

- Click Create new event

**Event configuration:**

| Field      | Value             |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Event name | `SqsProducerTest` |
| Template   | `Hello World`     |


#### 🟦 A3 — REPLACE EVENT JSON (IMPORTANT)

#### Delete everything and paste exactly:

```
{
  "body": "{\"customer_name\":\"ConsoleTest\",\"item\":\"Latte\",\"quantity\":2}"
}
```

#### ⚠️ Notice:

- body must be a STRING

- This simulates API Gateway behavior

#### 🟦 A4 — RUN TEST

- Click Save

- Click Test

#### ✅ EXPECTED RESULT (LAMBDA)

**Lambda Response:**

```
{
  "statusCode": 202,
  "body": "{\"message\": \"Order accepted\"}"
}
```

#### 🟦 A5 — VERIFY MESSAGE IN SQS

- AWS Console → SQS

- Click CafeOrdersQueue

- Click Send and receive messages

- Click Poll for messages

#### ✅ You should see:

```
{
  "customer_name": "ApiTestUser",
  "item": "Latte",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

If you see this → Producer Lambda works perfectly ✅

### 🌐 METHOD B — TEST USING API GATEWAY (REAL END-USER TEST)

This tests the full HTTP flow.

#### 🟦 B1 — OPEN API GATEWAY

- AWS Console → search API Gateway

- Click API Gateway

- Click your Order API (REST API)

#### 🟦 B2 — SELECT THE RESOURCE

#### In left panel, expand:

- /orders (or your order path)

- Click POST

#### 🟦 B3 — USE API GATEWAY TEST FEATURE

- Click Test (⚠️ NOT Deploy)

#### In Request Body, paste:

```
{
  "customer_name": "ApiTestUser",
  "item": "Latte",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

- Click Test

#### ✅ EXPECTED API RESPONSE 

#### Status:

```
202
```

#### Body:

```
{"message":"Order accepted"}
```

#### 🟦 B4 — VERIFY SQS MESSAGE

#### Same as before:

- SQS → CafeOrdersQueue

- Send and receive messages

- Poll for messages

#### You should see:

```
{
  "customer_name": "ApiTestUser",
  "item": "Latte",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

### 🌍 METHOD C — TEST USING PUBLIC API URL (OPTIONAL BUT REALISTIC)

#### If API is deployed:

#### 🟦 C1 — GET INVOKE URL

- API Gateway → Stages

- Click your stage (e.g., prod)

- Copy Invoke URL

#### Example:

```
https://abcd1234.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/orders
```

#### 🟦 C2 — TEST USING CURL (OPTIONAL)

```
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"order_id":"ORD-3001","item":"Tea","quantity":3}' \
  https://abcd1234.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/orders
```

#### 🟦 C3 — VERIFY SQS

- Same verification steps.

### 6️⃣ Worker Lambda

#### Must read:

```
table_number = order["table_number"]
```

#### and insert:

```
INSERT INTO orders (table_number, customer_name, item, quantity)
```

### 🧠 RULE TO REMEMBER (VERY IMPORTANT)

Every layer must send the SAME JSON shape

```
{
  "table_number": INT,
  "customer_name": STRING,
  "item": STRING,
  "quantity": INT
}
```

If one layer misses a field, the pipeline breaks.

**✅ PHASE 3️⃣ STATUS**

> **🟢 PHASE 3️⃣ COMPLETE & VERIFIED**
---
## PHASE 7️⃣ — Verification SQS/Worker LAMBDA (Consumer)

### 1️⃣ Test manually from Lambda console

#### 1️⃣ You must wrap the test event in Records:

- **Event name:** Test_CafeOrderWorker

```
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "body": "{\"table_number\": 1, \"customer_name\": \"WorkerTest\", \"item\": \"Coffee\", \"quantity\": 2}"
    }
  ]
}
```

✔ Inserts into RDS

✔ Updates DynamoDB

✔ No retries

✔ No errors

- This mimics SQS event structure

- Now the Lambda code won’t fail with 'Records'


#### ✅ EXPECTED CLOUDWATCH LOGS (SUCCESS)

You should see:

```
DEBUG: Lambda invoked
DEBUG: Event = {...}
DEBUG: Secret fetched
DEBUG: RDS connected
✅ Order processed: {...}
```

#### 2️⃣ Verify RDS

```
mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u cafe_user -p cafe_db
```

```
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY id DESC;
```

#### Expected row:

```
WorkerTest | Coffee | 2
```

#### 3️⃣ Verify DynamoDB

- DynamoDB → CafeMenu → Coffee

- Attribute orders increased

### 2️⃣ TEST END-TO-END (MANDATORY)

#### 🧪 TESTING OVERVIEW

```
API Gateway / Manual SQS
        ↓
CafeOrdersQueue
        ↓
CafeOrderWorker (AUTO)
        ↓
RDS + DynamoDB
```

**We will test in 2 ways:**

1️⃣ Direct SQS test (simplest, safest)

2️⃣ Full end-to-end API test

> **Start with Method 1. Do NOT skip it.**

#### ✅ METHOD 1 — TEST WORKER LAMBDA DIRECTLY VIA SQS (RECOMMENDED FIRST)

This avoids API Gateway confusion.

#### 🟩 STEP 1 — OPEN SQS QUEUE

- AWS Console → SQS

- Click CafeOrdersQueue

- Click Send and receive messages

#### 🟩 STEP 2 — SEND A TEST MESSAGE (MANUAL)
- Click Send message

- Message body (COPY EXACTLY):

```
{
  "table_number": 5,
  "customer_name": "WorkerTest",
  "item": "Coffee",
  "quantity": 2
}
```

Leave everything else default

- Click Send message

✅ Message successfully sent

#### 🟩 STEP 3 — WAIT (IMPORTANT)

⏳ Wait 5–10 seconds

Lambda polls SQS automatically

You do NOT click anything

#### 🟩 STEP 4 — CONFIRM MESSAGE IS CONSUMED

- Still inside CafeOrdersQueue

- Click Send and receive messages

- Click Poll for messages

#### Expected result:

```
No messages available
```

#### ✅ This means:

- Worker Lambda ran

- Message was deleted

- No errors

#### 🟩 STEP 5 — CHECK WORKER LAMBDA LOGS (MANDATORY)

- AWS Console → CloudWatch

- Click Logs → Log groups

#### Open:

```
/aws/lambda/CafeOrderWorker
```

- Click latest log stream

#### You should see lines like:

```
START RequestId:
Order processed: {'customer_name': 'WorkerTest', 'item': 'Coffee', 'quantity': 2}
END RequestId:
REPORT RequestId:
```

#### ✅ This confirms:

- Worker Lambda executed

- JSON parsed

- No retries

#### 🟩 STEP 6 — VERIFY DATABASE (MANDATORY)

#### From EC2 or DB client:

```
mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u cafe_user -p cafe_db
```

```
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY id DESC;
```

or 

```
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

#### Expected:

```
WorkerTest | Coffee | 2
```

table_number ✅

status = RECEIVED ✅

created_at auto-filled ✅

#### 🟩 STEP 7 — VERIFY DYNAMODB (CafeMenu)

- AWS Console → DynamoDB

- Click CafeMenu

- Click Explore table

- Click Coffee

#### Expected:

```
{
  "item": "Coffee",
  "price": 3,
  "orders": 14
}
```

- Attribute orders exists

- Value increased by 2

#### 🟩 STEP 8 — VERIFY CloudWatch Logs

```
✅ Order processed
```

No retries, no DLQ hits.



#### ✅ METHOD 1 COMPLETE

#### At this point:

- Worker Lambda is 100% working

- SQS trigger is correct

- IAM is correct

- VPC access is correct

#### 🚀 METHOD 2 — FULL END-TO-END TEST (API → SQS → WORKER)

Only do this AFTER Method 1 works

#### 🟦 STEP 1 — CALL API GATEWAY

#### From your terminal:

```
curl -X POST \
https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/orders \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "table_number": 2,
  "customer_name": "ApiTest",
  "item": "Latte",
  "quantity": 1
}'
```

#### Expected response:

```
{
  "message": "Order accepted"
}
```

#### 🟦 STEP 2 — CHECK SQS (BRIEFLY)

- Open CafeOrdersQueue

- You may see messages for a few seconds

- They should disappear automatically

#### 🟦 STEP 3 — CHECK WORKER LOGS

- CloudWatch → /aws/lambda/CafeOrderWorker

#### You should see:

```
Order processed: {'customer_name': 'ApiTest', 'item': 'Latte', 'quantity': 1}
```

#### 🟦 STEP 4 — VERIFY DB + DYNAMODB

- Same as Method 1

#### 🔁 FAILURE TEST (OPTIONAL BUT IMPORTANT)

#### To confirm retry behavior:

- Temporarily break worker code

```
raise Exception("FORCE FAIL")
```

- Send SQS message again

#### Observe:

- Message reappears after visibility timeout

- Multiple retries

- Logs show repeated failures

This proves production-grade reliability

### ✅ VERIFY SQS

#### 🟢 Method 1 — CloudWatch Logs (PRIMARY)

**CloudWatch → Logs →  /aws/lambda/CafeOrderWorker**

You should see entries like:

```
Lambda triggered by SQS
Order processed: {'customer_name': 'charlie', 'item': 'Tea', 'quantity': 2}
```

**✅ This is the proof.**

#### 🟢 Method 2 — SQS Metrics (BEST PRACTICE)

**SQS → CafeOrdersQueue → Monitoring**

#### Check these graphs:

| Metric                             | Expected |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| NumberOfMessagesSent               | ↑        |
| NumberOfMessagesReceived           | ↑        |
| NumberOfMessagesDeleted            | ↑        |
| ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible | ~0       |

**✅ If Received & Deleted increase, your pipeline is healthy.**

#### 🟢 Method 3 — Disable Trigger (FOR LEARNING ONLY)

#### If you want to see messages again:

1️⃣ Lambda → CafeOrderWorker

2️⃣ Disable SQS trigger

3️⃣ Send message

4️⃣ Poll manually → message appears

Re-enable trigger afterward.

### ⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT AWS RULE (REMEMBER THIS)

> **You NEVER manually poll SQS when Lambda trigger is enabled**

That’s two consumers competing for the same messages.

### 🧠 WHY YOU CANNOT SEE THE MESSAGE IN SQS

**When SQS → Lambda trigger is enabled:**

- Lambda polls SQS automatically

- Message is:

  - Retrieved

  - Processed

  - Deleted immediately on success

- When you click Poll for messages in the console:

  - There is nothing left to poll

So you will see:

```
No messages available
```
**✅ This is SUCCESS, not a failure.**

### 🔄 WHY YOU COULD SEE MESSAGES BEFORE

#### Earlier, when:

- Trigger was disabled

- Lambda failed

- Or Lambda didn’t raise exceptions

Messages stayed in the queue → you could poll them manually.

#### Now:

- Lambda succeeds

- Messages are deleted

- Queue stays empty

---


### 🔥 IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS

#### ❓ Why SQS message disappeared?

**Because Lambda DID poll it, but timed out before completing**

- SQS deletes message only after successful invocation, but Lambda retried internally until timeout.

#### ❓ Why no logs before?

**Because:**

- Lambda couldn’t reach RDS

- Timeout occurred before prints

#### ❓ Is your code correct?

✅ YES — your code is PRODUCTION-GRADE

The issue was INFRASTRUCTURE, not logic.

### 🧠 FINAL DIAGNOSIS

| Component          | Status    |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| SQS                | ✅ Working |
| Lambda trigger     | ✅ Working |
| IAM                | ✅ Correct |
| Code               | ✅ Correct |
| **VPC attachment** | ❌ Missing |
| **Timeout**        | ❌ Too low |



### 🔑 COMMON MISTAKES (READ THIS)

❌ Using FIFO queue

❌ Same Lambda for producer + consumer

❌ Visibility timeout too low

❌ No IAM permissions

❌ Batch size > 1 while learning

### 🧠 KEY RULES TO REMEMBER (EXAM + REAL LIFE)

| Rule                      | Truth                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Worker Lambda Test button | ❌ NOT USED               |
| SQS triggers Lambda       | ✅ AUTOMATIC              |
| Lambda deletes message    | ❌ AWS does after success |
| Exception = retry         | ✅ YES                    |
| No logs = no execution    | ❌ Wrong                  |

**✅ PHASE 7️⃣ STATUS**

> **🟢 PHASE 7️⃣ COMPLETE & VERIFIED**

## 🟢 SECTION 3️⃣ COMPLETE & VERIFIED
---

## SECTION 4️⃣ — ORDER STATUS DASHBOARD

## PHASE 2️⃣ — VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)

### 🔎 Test in Lambda

- **Go to Lambda → Test**

#### If secret access works:

- ❌ No timeout

- ❌ No access denied

- ✅ DB connects successfully

### 🔎 CloudWatch Log

#### You should see:

```
Fetching DB secret...
```

#### No error like:

```
AccessDeniedException: User is not authorized to perform secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
```

### 🧪 Updated Test JSON 

Use this in Test → Configure test event:

```
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "body": "{\"table_number\": 2, \"customer_name\": \"MetricsTest\", \"item\": \"Coffee\", \"quantity\": 1}"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ✅ After Testing You Should See:

#### In CafeOrderMetrics table:

```
TOTAL_ORDERS   → count increases
TODAY_ORDERS   → count increases
```

#### In CafeMenu table:

```
Coffee → orders increases
```

#### In RDS orders table:

- New row inserted.


**✅ PHASE 2️⃣ STATUS**

> **🟢 PHASE 2️⃣ COMPLETE & VERIFIED**

## PHASE 7️⃣ — FEATURE VERIFICATION (IMPORTANT)

### 1️⃣ Send order from frontend / API

✔ Order placed

### 2️⃣ Check SQS

✔ Message disappears (consumed)

### 3️⃣ Check RDS

```
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

✔ New row present

### 4️⃣ Check DynamoDB → CafeMenu

✔ orders increased for item

### 5️⃣ Check DynamoDB → CafeOrderMetrics

✔ TOTAL_ORDERS increased by 1

### 6️⃣ Check CloudWatch Logs

✔ "Order processed successfully"


### 7️⃣ Verify Apache is Running

```
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

#### If not running:

```
sudo systemctl start httpd
```

```
{
  "queryStringParameters": {
    "order_id": "ORD-TEST-123"
  }
}
```

#### Expected output:

}
```

### 🧪 STEP 7 — TEST API (CRITICAL)

#### Browser test:

```
https://xxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/status/cafe-order-status?order_id=ORD-123
```

#### Example:

```
https://q8rq19tfka.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/status/cafe-order-status?order_id=ORD-123
```

#### Expected output:

## 🔄 PHASE 3️⃣ — Real Order State Machine (RECEIVED → PREPARING → READY → COMPLETED)

### 🧪 STEP 3 — TEST ORDER CREATION

#### ✅ TEST 1 — Test Lambda DIRECTLY (mandatory first)

- AWS Console → Lambda → CreateOrderLambda

- Click Test → Create new test event

- test event name: CreateOrderLambda

Use this EXACT JSON:

```
{
  "body": "{\"table_number\":1,\"customer_name\":\"Test User\",\"item\":\"Coffee\",\"quantity\":3}"
}
```

- Click Test

#### ✅ Expected Lambda Response:

```
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\"order_id\":\"ORD-20260114-8392\",\"status\":\"RECEIVED\",\"total\":9.0,\"track_url\":\"/order-status.php?order_id=ORD-20260114-8392\"}"
}
```

✔ If this fails → STOP (Lambda bug)

✔ If this works → continue

#### ✅ TEST 2 Test from FRONTEND (REAL USER FLOW)

- Open frontend

```
http://54.147.142.110/orders.php
```

#### Fill form

- Table Number: 1

- Name: Charlie

- Item: Coffee

- Quantity: 3

#### Click Place Order

#### ✅ Expected behavior:

- Order placed

- Receipt shows Order ID

- Payment section loads

- After payment → redirect to:

```
/order-status.php?order_id=ORD-XXXX
```

### 🚨 Common Failures & Fixes

#### ❌ Invalid order reference

Cause: order_id not passed in URL
Fix: Make sure Lambda returns track_url AND frontend redirects to it

#### ❌ Lambda test works, API Gateway fails

Cause: Bad integration request mapping
Fix: Ensure API Gateway passes raw body to Lambda

#### ❌ Frontend works but no redirect

Cause: JS not reading Lambda response
Fix: Ensure frontend uses:
```
window.location.href = response.track_url;
```

#### Expected response:

```
{
  "order_id": "ORD-20260114-8392",
  "status": "RECEIVED",
  "total": 9.00,
  "track_url": "/order-status.php?order_id=..."
}
```

#### ✅ TEST 3 Test API Gateway (Lambda + API)

#### Copy API Gateway URL

```
https://bs0vgnth0f.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/orders
```

#### Run from EC2 / Local terminal

```
curl -X POST \
  https://bs0vgnth0f.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "table_number":1,
        "customer_name":"Test User",
        "item":"Coffee",
        "quantity":3
      }'
```

#### ✅ Expected Response:

```
{
  "order_id": "ORD-20260114-8392",
  "status": "RECEIVED",
  "total": 9.0,
  "track_url": "/order-status.php?order_id=ORD-20260114-8392"
}
```

✔ If this fails → API Gateway mapping issue

✔ If this works → continue

# SECTION 6️⃣ ☕ Charlie Café – Order Payment System

## ☕ CHARLIE CAFÉ PHASE 1️⃣ Cach Payment System 

### 5️⃣ 🧪 TEST SCENARIOS (DO THESE)

#### ✅ Test 1 — Manual API Test

Use Postman / curl:

```
POST /orders/cash-payment
{
  "order_id": "ORD-123"
}
```

#### Expected:

```
{
  "success": true
}
```

curl is usually pre-installed on EC2 instances. For your API:

```
curl -X POST \
  https://q8rq19tfka.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/orders/cash-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "order_id": "12345",
        "amount": 50,
        "customer": "John Doe"
      }'
```

#### Expected:

```
{"success": true, "message": "Order marked for cash payment"}
```

Explanation:

-X POST → specifies POST request

-H "Content-Type: application/json" → sets header to JSON

-d '{...}' → JSON body of the request

Expected result:
You should get a JSON response from your Lambda/API Gateway, e.g.:

```
{
  "message": "Order 12345 created successfully",
  "order": {
    "order_id": "12345",
    "amount": 50,
    "customer": "John Doe"
  }
}
```




#### ✅ Test 2 — DynamoDB Check

Open DynamoDB item:

```
payment_method = CASH
payment_status = PENDING
```

#### ✅ Test 3 — UI Test

- Place order

- Click Pay Now (Cash)

- Card UI disappears

- Redirect works

- Order shows pending payment

#### ✅ Test 4 — Test Event JSON (for Lambda Console)

- Go to your Lambda → CashPaymentLambda → Test tab

- Click Create new event (or Configure test event)

- Event name: e.g. TestCashPayment

- Template: Choose API Gateway AWS Proxy if available (recommended), or just paste custom JSON below

- Paste one of these into the editor:

Basic successful test (most common)

```

```
{
  "body": "{\"order_id\": \"ORD-20260131-5678\"}"
}
```

#### With more realistic API Gateway fields

  },
  "body": "{\"order_id\": \"ORD-20260131-9999\"}",
  "isBase64Encoded": false
}
```

#### ✅ Expected success (200):

```
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "headers": {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"
  },
  "body": "{\"success\": true, \"message\": \"Order marked for cash payment\"}"
}
```

## ☕ CHARLIE CAFÉ PHASE 2️⃣ Admin marks a CASH order as PAID

### 5️⃣ 🧪 TEST SCENARIOS (DO THESE)

- Customer places CASH order → order.php → payment-status.php shows Pay at Counter

- Admin clicks “Mark as Paid” → DynamoDB updates payment_status = PAID

- Customer refreshes payment-status.php → status changes Cash payment received

- Optional: Auto-redirect → print-order.php to print receipt

#### ✅ Test 1 — Manual Lambda Test

- Go to your Lambda function → Test tab

- Create new event (or edit existing)

- Paste the JSON above

- Give it a name like TestMarkPaid

- Click Test

#### Test Event JSON (for Lambda Console)
Copy-paste this exact JSON into the Test tab in your Lambda function:

```
{
  "body": "{\"order_id\": \"ORD-1738333333-456\"}",
  "httpMethod": "POST",
  "path": "/orders/cash-payment",
  "resource": "/orders/cash-payment",
  "requestContext": {
    "resourceId": "abc123",
    "resourcePath": "/orders/cash-payment",
    "httpMethod": "POST",
    "stage": "dev",
    "requestId": "test-request-id-1234",
    "identity": {
      "sourceIp": "127.0.0.1"

    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "queryStringParameters": null,
  "pathParameters": null,
  "stageVariables": null,
  "isBase64Encoded": false
}
```

#### Minimal Test Event (if you just want to simulate body)
> **(Shorter version — good for quick tests)**

This also works fine for your code:

```
{
  "body": "{\"order_id\": \"ORD-999999999-999\"}"
}
```

#### Expected successful output (if order exists in DynamoDB):

```
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "headers": {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"
  },
  "body": "{\"success\": true, \"message\": \"Order marked as PAID\"}"
}
```

#### ✅ Test 2 — Use Postman / curl:

```
POST /admin/mark-paid
{
  "order_id": "ORD-123"
}
```

#### Expected DynamoDB:

```
payment_status = PAID
```
