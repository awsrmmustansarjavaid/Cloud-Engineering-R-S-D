## ☕ Charlie Café PHASE 5️⃣ Secure Frontend & API Integration with Production Hardening
> **Frontend & Backend Security, API Integration, and Role-Based UI (Production Ready)**

### 1️⃣ Goal

- Integrate frontend pages (Admin + Employee) with backend APIs

- Enforce role-based UI & API access (Admin vs Employee)

- Add production-level hardening: error handling, loaders, JWT expiration, centralized config, secure backend checks, and logging

- Make the system job-ready, secure, and maintainable

### 2️⃣ Architecture Flow

```
[Frontend Admin/Employee Pages]
          |
          | secureFetch (with JWT)
          v
[API Gateway] -> Cognito Authorizer
          |
          v
[Lambdas (Checkin, Checkout, Employee Info, Leaves, Admin Employees)]
          |
          v
[RDS Database / DynamoDB]
```

#### Enhancements for merged phase:

- JWT validation & token expiration handled in frontend

- Role detection & UI enforcement in frontend

- Backend role enforcement in Lambdas

- Logging & error handling (CloudWatch)

- Loading indicators & centralized config in frontend

### 3️⃣ Achievements

- Unified auth & API layer for Admin & Employee

- Enterprise-grade security (frontend + backend)

- Job-ready UX polish: loader, error messages, responsive UI

- Scalable & maintainable codebase

- Audit & observability: logs for debugging and production monitoring

### 4️⃣ Tasks List

#### 1️⃣ Frontend Tasks

- Centralize config (API URL, Cognito IDs)

- Create auth-api.js with:

    - JWT token fetch

    - Secure API helper

    - Role detection

    - UI enforcement for Admin/Employee

    - Global error handler

    - Loader functions

    - Logout function

- Update Admin & Employee pages:

    - Include Cognito SDK

    - Include config.js + auth-api.js

    - Call protectPage() + enforceAdminAccess() / enforceEmployeeAccess()

- Replace API calls in pages with secureFetch

#### 1️⃣ Backend Tasks (Lambdas)

- Add logging (CloudWatch)

- Enforce role check using JWT claims

- Replace “Function logic goes here” with specific business logic (checkin, checkout, profile, leaves, admin employees)

- Return structured JSON responses

#### Testing Tasks

Frontend: Login, logout, access control, loader, error handling

Backend: Authorized vs unauthorized role access, CloudWatch logging

### 5️⃣ Anything else helpful for research / case study

Show centralized config improves maintainability

Explain role enforcement both frontend & backend prevents security bypass

Include JWT expiration handling as production-ready feature

Highlight CloudWatch logging as audit & monitoring

Emphasize loader + error handling for professional UX

Include flow diagram of merged phase for documentation / case study
